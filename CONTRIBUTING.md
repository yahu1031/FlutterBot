## Get Started ##

### Fork the project :fork_and_knife: ###

Fork us to your repo and help us developing more better. Create a branch in the forked repo and work on the branch. Make [PR(Pull Request)](https://github.com/yahu1031/FlutterBot/pull) on what ever you worked on. PRs are most welcome.

### Development Environment :hammer: ###

1) Clone your forked repository.

    ```sh
    git clone "your repo link"
    ```

2) Install required packages.

    ```sh
    dart pub get
    ```

3) Be ready to develop it :wink:.

### Test server and bot account :zap: ###

You will be needed your own test server and bot account on Discord to test the bot with your changes.

1) [Create a Discord server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-).
2) [Create a Discord developer account](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).

Invite the FlutterBot to the server you have created. If you are not aware of adding a bot to the server, Here is the [Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots) to do it.

### Configure the bot :wrench: ###

To configure the bot you must need to add some **variables**.

In the root dir create a file called `.env` and add the variables in the file.

  ```txt
    BOT_TOKEN=<your bot token>

    PREFIX=!

    CLIENT_ID=<ID of the bot OAuth2 client>
  ```

  > **Note:**
  >
  > 1) Prefix variable is recommended to be `!`.
  >
  > 2) The links in the environment variables must not be disturbed.

### Run the project :running: ###

You are almost done with the setup and start running the bot

  ```sh
  dart ./bin/flutter_bot.dart
  ```

If your output in the console seems like this

  ```log
  SUCCESS [Tue, 9/6/2022 3:01:30 AM] - Flutter Bot#1358 is ready to go üî•
  ```

then, Congrats you made it.

### Working with Git :man_technologist: ###
